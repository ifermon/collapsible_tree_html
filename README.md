The objective of this code is to create an HTML file that allows users to see a visual representation of the supervisory org structure prior to the data being loaded into WD. This should allow for validation of the data before being loaded.

It supports the following:

- Supervisory Organization structure
- Supervisory Organization default orgs (e.g. cost center, company, etc)
- Roles for supervisory organization (e.g. manager, HR Partner, etc). Along with the name and employee ID for the workers holding those positions

On a mac, in terminal (i.e. - the command line) type "python build_tree.py --help" to get a list of commands
